Exercise 4.1.
Prove that if $\mathbf U$ is unitary, and if $|A\rangle$ and $|B\rangle$
are any two state vectors, then the inner product of $\mathbf U|A\rangle$
and $\mathbf U|B\rangle$ is the same as the inner product of
$|A\rangle$ and $|B\rangle$.
One could call this the {\it conservation of overlaps.}
It expresses the fact that the logical relation between states is preserved
with time.

If $\mathbf U$ is unitary then
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf U^\dag\mathbf U=I
\end{equation*}

Hence
\begin{equation*}
\langle A|\mathbf U^\dag\mathbf U|B\rangle
=\langle A|I|B\rangle
=\langle A|B\rangle
\end{equation*}
