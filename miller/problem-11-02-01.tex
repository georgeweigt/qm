11.2.1
Consider a double barrier structure consisting of two barriers of height 1 eV
and thickness 0.3 nm on either side of a 1 nm thick region of zero potential
energy, with the regions on the left and the right of the entire structure
assumed to have zero potential energy.
Construct a transfer matrix model for that structure, and calculate the
tunneling probability of an electron through the structure as a function of
electron energy from 0 eV to 1 eV, graphing the resulting transmission
probability.
