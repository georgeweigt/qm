26-1.
Consider a single particle with a spin and
magnetic moment described by matrices $\Sigma_1$,
$\Sigma_2$, $\Sigma_3$ in addition to position and momentum
represented by matrices $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$ and $P_1$, $P_2$,
$P_3$. Then $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$ are the same as in Problem
25-2 and $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_3$ are the same as in Problem
24-6. Let
\begin{equation*}
H=\frac{1}{2m}\left({P_1}^2+{P_2}^2+{P_3}^2\right).
\end{equation*}

Show that the matrix $\Omega=(1/\hbar)H$ commutes
with $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$ and $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_3$. It also commutes
with $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Sigma_3$, so the spin and magnetic
moment are constant in time. Show that the
orbital angular momentum represented by $L_1$,
$L_2$, $L_3$ also is constant in time.

The Eigenmath solution verifies that
\begin{align*}
HJ_1&=J_1H\\
HJ_2&=J_2H\\
HJ_3&=J_3H
\\[1ex]
HK_1&=K_1H\\
HK_2&=K_2H\\
HK_3&=K_3H
\\[1ex]
HL_1&=L_1H\\
HL_2&=L_2H\\
HL_3&=L_3H
\end{align*}

Also
\begin{equation*}
L_1\Omega=\Omega L_1,\quad L_2\Omega=\Omega L_2,\quad L_3\Omega=\Omega L_3
\end{equation*}

which shows that $L$ are constant in time.
