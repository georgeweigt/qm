Show that the eight matrices
\begin{gather*}
\Sigma_1,\quad-i\Sigma_2,\quad\Sigma_3,\quad-1
\\
-\Sigma_1,\quad i\Sigma_2,\quad-\Sigma_3,\quad 1
\end{gather*}

form a group. This is an alternative that works
as well as the standard combination to represent
the group of $180^\circ$ rotations around the
1, 2, 3 axes and the identity rotation. All these
matrices are real.
}}

\bigskip
The eight matrices have an identity.

\bigskip
Each matrix has an inverse.
\begin{align*}
\Sigma_1\Sigma_1&=1 & (i\Sigma_2)(-i\Sigma_2)&=1 & \Sigma_3\Sigma_3&=1
\\
(-\Sigma_1)(-\Sigma_1)&=1 & (-i\Sigma_2)(i\Sigma_2)&=1 & (-\Sigma_3)(-\Sigma_3)&=1
\end{align*}
