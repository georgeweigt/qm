5-6. Two potential wells of width $a$ are separated by a distance $L\gg a$.
A particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$ is in one of the wells.
Estimate the time required for the particle to tunnel to the other well.

\bigskip
Recall that $|T|^2$ is the transmission probability.

\bigskip
The particle velocity is
\begin{equation*}
v=\sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}}
\end{equation*}

The tunneling trial frequency is
\begin{equation*}
\nu=\frac{v}{2a}
\end{equation*}

The tunneling process is a geometric distribution with mean
\begin{equation*}
\mu=\frac{1}{|T|^2}
\end{equation*}

Hence the expected tunneling time is
\begin{equation*}
\langle t\rangle=\frac{\mu}{\nu}
=\frac{2a}{v|T|^2}
=\frac{2a}{|T|^2}\sqrt{\frac{m}{2E}}
\end{equation*}

The travel time is distance divided by velocity.
\begin{equation*}
t=\frac{L}{v}=L\sqrt{\frac{m}{2E}}
\end{equation*}

The total time is tunnel time plus travel time.
\begin{equation*}
\langle t\rangle+t
=\left(\frac{2a}{|T|^2}+L\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{2E}}
\end{equation*}
